# Homework-01

code refactor 

Provided code was missing appropriate semantic tags necessary for the page. I have added tags to each area that seemed necessary in order to more properly define the heirarchy of the content on the page.

redundant classes removed and css changed in order to select the ID instead of the class. 

Any div that was no longer needed was commented out, but left in the file in order to show what changes I have made.
